    title: 'The Return to Office Debate',
    dateline: '2024-2025',
    whatHappened: 'Five years after the pandemic forced mass remote work, major companies are pushing employees back to offices. Amazon, Dell, and JPMorgan Chase have mandated five-day office returns. KPMG\'s CEO Outlook found 83% of CEOs expect full RTO by 2027. Meanwhile, Stanford\'s largest study yet found hybrid work has "zero effect" on productivity while cutting resignations by 33%.',
    whyControversial: 'Executives cite collaboration, culture, and innovation as reasons for mandates. Employees value flexibility — 46% say they\'d look for new work if remote options ended. Research from MIT Sloan shows mandates damage engagement and increase attrition "especially among high-performing employees." A BambooHR survey found 25% of executives admit RTO mandates were meant to trigger voluntary departures.',
    previewInsight: 'We\'ll identify what groups actually agree on (more than you\'d expect), locate the genuine points of disagreement, and explain why this debate may be more about values than facts.',
    pollingSummary: 'Workers prefer flexibility: 64% prefer remote or hybrid over full-time office. 46% would look for new work if remote options ended. Meanwhile, 83% of CEOs expect full RTO by 2027.',
