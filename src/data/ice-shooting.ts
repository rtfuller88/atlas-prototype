  executiveSummary: {
    title: 'The Killing of Renee Good',
    dateline: 'Minneapolis, MN — January 7, 2026',
    whatHappened: 'During a large-scale ICE enforcement operation, agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good, a 37-year-old U.S. citizen, mother, and poet. Good had stopped her SUV in a residential street and was whistling to alert neighbors to ICE presence — a common practice among community observers. DHS claims she attempted to run over officers; multiple videos show a more ambiguous sequence.',
    whyControversial: 'Federal officials labeled Good\'s actions "domestic terrorism." Video evidence analyzed by multiple news organizations appears to contradict key elements of the official account. The FBI revoked Minnesota investigators\' access to evidence, and six federal prosecutors in Minnesota resigned over the Justice Department\'s handling of the case. Polling shows Americans deeply divided along partisan lines.',
    previewInsight: 'We\'ll break down this issue into its component claims, show you where there\'s more agreement than the debate suggests, and identify the specific points where reasonable people genuinely disagree — and why.',
    pollingSummary: 'Sharply divided along partisan lines: 56% say shooting was unjustified, 33% say justified (Quinnipiac). Split widens dramatically by party — 91% of Democrats vs. 24% of Republicans say unjustified.',
