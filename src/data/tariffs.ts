  executiveSummary: {
    title: 'Tariffs and the Trade War',
    dateline: 'Washington, D.C. — February 2025 through January 2026',
    whatHappened: 'Starting in February 2025, the Trump administration imposed sweeping tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada, invoking national emergencies over fentanyl trafficking. "Liberation Day" in April brought tariffs on nearly every country, with US-China tariffs briefly reaching 145% and 125% respectively. The average effective US tariff rate rose from 2.5% to 27% — the highest in over a century — before partial rollbacks brought it to 16.8% by November 2025.',
    whyControversial: 'Proponents argue tariffs protect American workers and manufacturing, reduce trade deficits, and counter unfair foreign practices. Critics point to higher consumer prices ($1,100-$1,500 per household), manufacturing job losses (59,000 since April), and warnings from 1,500+ economists. Polling shows 61% disapprove of the tariff policy, though tolerance varies by party and willingness to accept economic disruption.',
    previewInsight: 'We\'ll break down where groups agree on facts, identify the core disputes about costs vs. benefits, and show why this debate is unlikely to be resolved by more data alone.',
    pollingSummary: 'Clear majority opposed: 61% disapprove of tariff increases, 38% approve (Pew, August 2025). Only white non-college men say tariffs help more than hurt.',

  summaryInsight: 'This debate reveals how different groups weigh short-term costs against long-term strategic goals. Most agree tariffs raise prices, but disagree on whether that cost is acceptable for other objectives like reshoring manufacturing or countering China. The core dispute is about values and time horizons, not facts.',
