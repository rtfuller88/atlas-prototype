  executiveSummary: {
    title: 'The TikTok Ban',
    dateline: 'Washington, D.C. — January 2025 through January 2026',
    whatHappened: 'Congress passed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act in April 2024, requiring TikTok\'s Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell the app or face a ban. The Supreme Court upheld the law on January 17, 2025. TikTok briefly went dark on January 19 before Trump issued executive orders delaying enforcement. After months of negotiations, a deal was announced in September 2025 creating a new US-majority-owned entity, with ByteDance owning less than 20%.',
    whyControversial: 'The law pits national security concerns against First Amendment rights. Supporters cite ByteDance\'s obligations under Chinese law to share data with the government and documented instances of China-based employees accessing US user data. Opponents, including the ACLU, argue the ban is unprecedented censorship of a platform used by 170 million Americans. Polling shows public opinion has shifted dramatically, with support for a ban falling from 50% in 2023 to 34% in 2025.',
    previewInsight: 'We\'ll break down where these four groups actually agree, identify the specific points of genuine disagreement, and show why new evidence may not resolve the core dispute.',
    pollingSummary: 'Public opinion is closely divided: 34% support a ban, 32% oppose, 33% unsure (Pew, March 2025). TikTok users overwhelmingly oppose (88%).',
